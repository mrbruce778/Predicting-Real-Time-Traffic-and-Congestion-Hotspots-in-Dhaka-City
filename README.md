# Predicting-Real-Time-Traffic-and-Congestion-Hotspots-in-Dhaka-City
This project evaluates four deep learning models (CNN, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) for classifying traffic congestion using optical images. EfficientNetB0 performed best in accuracy, F1 score, and AUC. Dataset issues, particularly conflicting traffic scenarios, limited performance.
