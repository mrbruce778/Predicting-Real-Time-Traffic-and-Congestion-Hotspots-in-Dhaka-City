Traffic congestion prediction is a critical challenge
for urban management, particularly in densely populated cities
like Dhaka. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four
deep learning models namely CNN, ResNet50, MobileNetV2 and
EfficientNetB0 for classifying traffic congestion levels based on
optical images. The dataset was manually labeled into four
categories: No Traffic, Light Traffic, Moderate Traffic, and Heavy
Traffic. Each model was trained on images resized to dimensions
of 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512 to assess performance at
varying resolutions. Among the models, EfficientNetB0 emerged
as the best performer, achieving the highest accuracy , F1 score,
and AUC on the ROC curve, while also maintaining efficient
training times. However, a key dataset limitation is conflicting
traffic scenarios in two-way roads which caused significant
model confusion and limited overall performance. This paper
highlights the importance of addressing dataset quality issues and
proposes that minimizing these flaws could result in a dramatic
improvement in model accuracy. The findings provide valuable
insights into the application of AI in urban traffic management
and pave the way for future advancements in this field.
